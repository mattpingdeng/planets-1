I learned that pull is the combination of fetch and merge. It makes 
sense to be able to break it into two parts to check which edits are 
going to happen to the files. When I did fetch upstream, everything was 
already up to date. I know this is because the files weren't edited 
after I added your repository as a remote. I think thus far things have 
been pretty clear. The only thing I'm a little concerned about is 
keeping all of the different repositories in check.
